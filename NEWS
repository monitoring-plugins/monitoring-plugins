	WARNINGS
	New default installation prefix: /usr/local instead of /usr/local/nagios
	check_snmp now evaluates negative values properly, which means it might return CRITICAL
	  in cases where it used to return OK. If this is undesired, the warning/critical

	check_procs now ignores its parent process to avoid unexpected results when invoked via
	  certain shells

	  option, or "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin" by default

	  after completion of the response
	Check_ldaps' guessing which secure method to use (starttls vs. ssl on connect)
	  is now deprecated. See --help for further information.
	Check_disk now calls stat() on all filesystems to check. (Old: only the ones selected using -p)
	  A meaningful error message (eg "Stale NFS Handle") is printed if stat fails.
	New check_disk option -L: Only check local filesystems, but call stat() on remote ones, too.
	  Thus accessibility of remote filesystems can be checked without any threshold comparison.

	New check_disk -i/-I option to ignore pathes/partitions based on regular expressions
	New check_disk -A option to select all filesystems explicitly

	  Passing -E after -p or -r results in UNKNOWN state, now
	  This is needed due to the new ignore feature

	New check_dhcp -u/--unicast option for emulating a DHCP relay in order
	  to check DHCP servers on remote networks

	The (undocumented) positional parameter parsing which check_radius used
	  instead of getopt(3) if 8 arguments were given is no longer available
