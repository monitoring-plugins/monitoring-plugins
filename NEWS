	  is now deprecated. See --help for further information.
	Check_disk now calls stat() on all filesystems to check. (Old: only the ones selected using -p)
	  A meaningful error message (eg "Stale NFS Handle") is printed if stat fails.
	New check_disk option -L: Only check local filesystems, but call stat() on remote ones, too.
	  Thus accessibility of remote filesystems can be checked without any threshold comparison.

	The "negate" utility can now remap custom states
	Check_radius now supports radiusclient-ng
	The (undocumented) positional parameter parsing which check_radius used
	  instead of getopt(3) if 8 arguments were given is no longer available
