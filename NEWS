	Fix compilation with GnuTLS

	WARNINGS
	New default installation prefix: /usr/local instead of /usr/local/nagios
	check_snmp now evaluates negative values properly, which means it might return CRITICAL
	  in cases where it used to return OK. If this is undesired, the warning/critical

	  option, or "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin" by default

	  implement stratum thresholds support (feature request #1703823).
	check_ntp now returns UNKNOWN instead of WARNING if jitter is unavailable (jitter=-1.000000)
	  as long as the thresholds range include -1. If no offset threshold is specified

	  is now deprecated. See --help for further information.
	Check_disk now calls stat() on all filesystems to check. (Old: only the ones selected using -p)
	  A meaningful error message (eg "Stale NFS Handle") is printed if stat fails.
	New check_disk option -L: Only check local filesystems, but call stat() on remote ones, too.
	  Thus accessibility of remote filesystems can be checked without any threshold comparison.

	The "negate" utility can now remap custom states

	The (undocumented) positional parameter parsing which check_radius used
	  instead of getopt(3) if 8 arguments were given is no longer available
