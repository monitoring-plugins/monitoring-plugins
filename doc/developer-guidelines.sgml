	<para>
	Nagios Plugins are developed to the GNU standard, so any OS which is supported by GNU
	should run the plugins. While the requirements for compiling the Nagios Plugins release 
	are very basic, developing from the Git repository requires additional software to be
	installed. These are the minimum levels of software required:

	<literallayout>
	GNU make 3.79
	GNU automake 1.9.2
	GNU autoconf 2.59
	GNU m4 1.4.2
	GNU libtool 1.5
	</literallayout>

	To compile from Git, after you have cloned the repository, run:
	<literallayout>
	tools/setup
	./configure
	make
	make install
	</literallayout>
	</para>
</section>

<section id="PlugOutput"><title>Plugin Output for Nagios</title>
	
		<para>You should always print something to STDOUT that tells if the 
		service is working or why it is failing. Try to keep the output short - 
		probably less that 80 characters. Remember that you ideally would like 
		the entire output to appear in a pager message, which will get chopped
		off after a certain length.</para>

		<para>As Nagios does not capture stderr output, you should only output to 
		STDOUT and not print to STDERR.</para>

		<section><title>Print only one line of text</title>
		<para>Starting with version 3, Nagios will process plugins' multiline
		output, which should be formatted as:</para>
		<literallayout>
		SERVICE STATUS: First line of output | First part of performance data
		Any number of subsequent lines of output, but note that buffers
		may have a limited size | Second part of performance data, which
		may have continuation lines, too
		</literallayout>
		<para>Note, however, that the default configs still do not include
		the output's continuation lines into the notifications sent when
		Nagios notifies contacts about potential problems.
		Thus, keep your output short and to the point.</para>

		<para>Output should be in the format:</para>
		<literallayout>
		SERVICE STATUS: Information text
		</literallayout>
		<para>However, note that this is not a requirement of the API, so you cannot depend on this
		being an accurate reflection of the status of the service - the status should always 
		be determined by the return code.</para>
		</section>

		<section><title>Verbose output</title>
		<para>Use the -v flag for verbose output. You should allow multiple
		-v options for additional verbosity, up to a maximum of 3. The standard
		type of output should be:</para>

		<table id="verboselevels"><title>Verbose output levels</title>
			<tgroup cols="2">
				<thead>
					<row>

					</row>
				</tbody>
			</tgroup>
		</table>
		</section>

		<section><title>Screen Output</title>
		<para>The plugin should print the diagnostic and just the
		usage part of the help message.  A well written plugin would
		then have --help as a way to get the verbose help.</para>

		<para>Code and output should try to respect the 80x25 size of a
		crt (remember when fixing stuff in the server room!)</para>
		</section>
		
		<section><title>Plugin Return Codes</title>
		<para>The return codes below are based on the POSIX spec of returning
		a positive value.  Netsaint prior to v0.0.7 supported non-POSIX
		compliant return code of "-1" for unknown.  Nagios supports POSIX return
		codes by default.</para>

		<para>Note: Some plugins will on occasion print on STDOUT that an error
		occurred and error code is 138 or 255 or some such number.  These
		are usually caused by plugins using system commands and having not 
		enough checks to catch unexpected output.  Developers should include a
		default catch-all for system command output that returns an UNKNOWN
		return code.</para>

						generally NOT be reported as UNKNOWN states.

		<section id="thresholdformat"><title>Threshold and ranges</title>
		<para>A range is defined as a start and end point (inclusive) on a numeric scale (possibly
		negative or positive infinity).
		</para>
		<para>A threshold is a range with an alert level (either warning or critical). Use the
		set_thresholds(thresholds *, char *, char *) function to set the thresholds.
		</para>
		<para>The theory is that the plugin will do some sort of check which returns
		back a numerical value, or metric, which is then compared to the warning and 
		critical thresholds. Use the get_status(double, thresholds *) function to
		compare the value against the thresholds.</para>
		<para>This is the generalised format for ranges:</para>

		<literallayout>
		[@]start:end
		</literallayout>
	
		<para>Notes:</para>
		<orderedlist>
		<listitem><para>start &le; end</para>

		<listitem><para>alert is raised if metric is outside start and end range
			(inclusive of endpoints)</para>
			</listitem>
		<listitem><para>if range starts with "@", then alert if inside this range
			(inclusive of endpoints)</para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>
		
		<para>Note: Not all plugins are coded to expect ranges in this format yet.
		There will be some work in providing multiple metrics.</para>

		<section><title>Performance data</title>
		<para>Nagios 3 and newer will concatenate the parts following a "|" in a) the first
		line output by the plugin, and b) in the second to last line, into a string it
		passes to whatever performance data processing it has configured. (Note that it
		currently does not insert additional whitespace between both, so the plugin needs
		to provide some to prevent the last pair of a) and the first of b) getting run
		together.) Please refer to the Nagios documentation for information on how to
		configure such processing. However, it is the responsibility of the plugin writer
		to ensure the performance data is in a "Nagios Plugins" format.
		This is the expected format:</para>

		<literallayout>
		'label'=value[UOM];[warn];[crit];[min];[max]
		</literallayout>

		<para>Notes:</para>
		<orderedlist>
		<listitem><para>space separated list of label/value pairs</para>
			</listitem>
		<listitem><para>label can contain any characters except the equals sign or single quote (')</para>
			</listitem>
		<listitem><para>the single quotes for the label are optional. Required if 
			spaces are in the label</para>
			</listitem>
		<listitem><para>label length is arbitrary, but ideally the first 19 characters
			are unique (due to a limitation in RRD). Be aware of a limitation in the
			amount of data that NRPE returns to Nagios</para>
			</listitem>
		<listitem><para>to specify a quote character, use two single quotes</para>
			</listitem>
		<listitem><para>warn, crit, min or max may be null (for example, if the threshold is 
			not defined or min and max do not apply). Trailing unfilled semicolons can be
			dropped</para>

			</listitem>
		<listitem><para>value, min and max in class [-0-9.]. Must all be the

			</listitem>
		<listitem><para>warn and crit are in the range format (see

		full path</title>
		<para>Don't use exec(), popen(), etc. to execute external
		commands without explicity using the full path of the external

		<para>Doing otherwise makes the plugin vulnerable to hijacking
		by a trojan horse earlier in the search path. See the main
		plugin distribution for examples on how this is done.</para>
		</section>

		<section><title>Use spopen() if external commands must be executed</title>

	    <para>If you have to execute external commands from within your
    	plugin and you're writing it in C, use the spopen() function

		<para>The code for spopen() and spclose() is included with the
		core plugin distribution.</para>
		</section>

		<section><title>Don't make temp files unless absolutely required</title>

		<para>If temp files are needed, make sure that the plugin will

<section id="PerlPlugin"><title>Perl Plugins</title>

		<para>Perl plugins are coded a little more defensively than other
		plugins because of embedded Perl.  When configured as such, embedded
		Perl Nagios (ePN) requires stricter use of the some of Perl's features.
		This section outlines some of the steps needed to use ePN
		effectively.</para>
	  
		<orderedlist>
			
			<listitem><para> Do not use BEGIN and END blocks since they will be called 
			only once (when Nagios starts and shuts down) with Embedded Perl (ePN).  In 
			particular, do not use BEGIN blocks to initialize variables.</para>
			</listitem>
	  
			<listitem><para>To use utils.pm, you need to provide a full path to the
			module in order for it to work.</para>
			
	  <literallayout>
	  e.g.
		use lib "/usr/local/nagios/libexec";
		use utils qw(...);
	  </literallayout>
	  		</listitem>

			<listitem><para>Perl scripts should be called with "-w"</para>
	  		</listitem>
			
			<listitem><para>All Perl plugins must compile cleanly under "use strict" - i.e. at
			least explicitly package names as in "$main::x" or predeclare every
			variable. </para>
			

			<para>Explicitly initialize each variable in use.  Otherwise with
			caching enabled, the plugin will not be recompiled each time, and
			therefore Perl will not reinitialize all the variables.  All old
			variable values will still be in effect.</para>
	  		</listitem>
			
			<listitem><para>Do not use &gt;DATA&lt; handles (these simply do not compile under ePN).</para>
	   		</listitem>

			<listitem><para>Do not use global variables in named subroutines. This is bad practise anyway, but with ePN the
			compiler will report an error "&lt;global_var&gt; will not stay shared ..". Values used by
			subroutines should be passed in the argument list.</para> 
			</listitem>

			<listitem><para>If writing to a file (perhaps recording
			performance data) explicitly close close it.  The plugin never
			calls <emphasis role="strong">exit</emphasis>; that is caught by
			p1.pl, so output streams are never closed.</para>
			</listitem>
		
			<listitem><para>As in <xref linkend="runtime"> all plugins need 
			to monitor their runtime, specially if they are using network
			resources.  Use of the <emphasis>alarm</emphasis> is recommended
			noting that some Perl modules (eg LWP) manage timers, so that an alarm
			set by a plugin using such a module is overwritten by the module.
			(workarounds are cunning (TM) or using the module timer)
			Plugins may import a default time out ($TIMEOUT) from utils.pm.
			</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem><para>Perl plugins should import %ERRORS from utils.pm
			and then "exit $ERRORS{'OK'}" rather than "exit 0"
			</para>
			</listitem>
			
		</orderedlist>
	  
</section>

<section id="runtime"><title>Runtime Timeouts</title>

		<para>Plugins have a very limited runtime - typically 10 sec.
		As a result, it is very important for plugins to maintain internal
		code to exit if runtime exceeds a threshold. </para>

		<para>All plugins should timeout gracefully, not just networking
		plugins. For instance, df may lock if you have automounted
		drives and your network fails - but on first glance, who'd think
		df could lock up like that.  Plus, it should just be more error
		resistant to be able to time out rather than consume
		resources.</para>
		
		<section><title>Use DEFAULT_SOCKET_TIMEOUT</title>

		<para>All network plugins should use DEFAULT_SOCKET_TIMEOUT to timeout</para>

		</section>

		
		<section><title>Add alarms to network plugins</title>

		<para>If you write a plugin which communicates with another
		networked host, you should make sure to set an alarm() in your
		code that prevents the plugin from hanging due to abnormal
		socket closures, etc. Nagios takes steps to protect itself
		against unruly plugins that timeout, but any plugins you create
		should be well behaved on their own.</para>

		</section>

		

</section>

<section id="PlugOptions"><title>Plugin Options</title>
	
		<para>A well written plugin should have --help as a way to get 
		verbose help. Code and output should try to respect the 80x25 size of a
		crt (remember when fixing stuff in the server room!)</para>
		
		<section><title>Option Processing</title>

		<para>For plugins written in C, we recommend the C standard
		getopt library for short options. Getopt_long is always available.
		</para>

		<para>For plugins written in Perl, we recommend Getopt::Long module.</para>

		<para>Positional arguments are strongly discouraged.</para>

		<para>There are a few reserved options that should not be used
		for other purposes:</para>

		<literallayout>
          -V version (--version)
          -h help (--help)
          -t timeout (--timeout)
          -w warning threshold (--warning)
          -c critical threshold (--critical)
          -H hostname (--hostname)
          -v verbose (--verbose)
		</literallayout>

		<para>In addition to the reserved options above, some other standard options are:</para>

		<literallayout>
          -C SNMP community (--community)
          -a authentication password (--authentication)
          -l login name (--logname)
          -p port or password (--port or --passwd/--password)monitors operational
          -u url or username (--url or --username)
		</literallayout>
	  
		<para>Look at check_pgsql and check_procs to see how I currently
		think this can work.  Standard options are:</para>

	  
		<para>The option -V or --version should be present in all
		plugins. For C plugins it should result in a call to print_revision, a
		function in utils.c which takes two character arguments, the
		command name and the plugin revision.</para>

		<para>The -? option, or any other unparsable set of options,
		should print out a short usage statement. Character width should
		be 80 and less and no more that 23 lines should be printed (it
		should display cleanly on a dumb terminal in a server
		room).</para>

		<para>The option -h or --help should be present in all plugins.
		In C plugins, it should result in a call to print_help (or
		equivalent).  The function print_help should call print_revision, 
		then print_usage, then should provide detailed
		help. Help text should fit on an 80-character width display, but
		may run as many lines as needed.</para>

		<para>The option -v or --verbose should be present in all plugins.
		The user should be allowed to specify -v multiple times to increase
		the verbosity level, as described in <xref linkend="verboselevels">.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Plugins with more than one type of threshold, or with
      threshold ranges</title>

      <para>Old style was to do things like -ct for critical time and
      -cv for critical value. That goes out the window with POSIX
      getopt. The allowable alternatives are:</para>

      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>long options like -critical-time (or -ct and -cv, I
	  suppose).</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>repeated options like `check_load -w 10 -w 6 -w 4 -c
	  16 -c 10 -c 10`</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>for brevity, the above can be expressed as `check_load
	  -w 10,6,4 -c 16,10,10`</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>ranges are expressed with colons as in `check_procs -C
	  httpd -w 1:20 -c 1:30` which will warn above 20 instances,
	  and critical at 0 and above 30</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>lists are expressed with commas, so Jacob's check_nmap
	  uses constructs like '-p 1000,1010,1050:1060,2000'</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If possible when writing lists, use tokens to make the
	  list easy to remember and non-order dependent - so
	  check_disk uses '-c 10000,10%' so that it is clear which is
	  the precentage and which is the KB values (note that due to
	  my own lack of foresight, that used to be '-c 10000:10%' but
	  such constructs should all be changed for consistency,
	  though providing reverse compatibility is fairly
	  easy).</para>
	</listitem>

      </orderedlist>

      <para>As always, comments are welcome - making this consistent
      without a host of long options was quite a hassle, and I would
      suspect that there are flaws in this strategy. 
      </para>
    </section>
</section>

<section id="Testcases"><title>Test cases</title>
<para>
Tests are the best way of knowing if the plugins work as expected. Please
create and update test cases where possible.
</para>

<para>
To run a test, from the top level directory, run "make test". This will run 
all the current tests and report an overall success rate.
</para>

<para>
See the <ulink url="http://tinderbox.opsera.com">Nagios Plugins Tinderbox server</ulink>
for the daily test results.
</para>

<section><title>Test cases for plugins</title>
<para>These use perl's Test::More. To do a one time test, run "cd plugins && perl t/check_disk.t".
</para>

<para>There will somtimes be failures seen in this output which are known failures that
need to be fixed. As long as the return code is 0, it will be reported as "test pass".
(If you have a fix so that the specific test passes, that will be gratefully received!)
</para>

<para>
If you want a summary test, run: "cd plugins && prove t/check_disk.t".
This runs the test in a summary format.

<section><title>Testing the C library functions</title>
<para>
We use <ulink url="http://jc.ngo.org.uk/trac-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/LibTap">the libtap library</ulink>, which gives 
perl's TAP
(Test Anything Protocol) output. This is used by the FreeBSD team for their regression testing.
</para>

<para>
To run tests using the libtap library, download the latest tar ball and extract. 
There is a problem with tap-1.01 where 
<ulink url="http://jc.ngo.org.uk/trac-bin/trac.cgi/ticket/25">pthread support doesn't appear to work</ulink>
properly on non-FreeBSD systems. Install with 'CPPFLAGS="-UHAVE_LIBPTHREAD" ./configure && make && make check && make install'. 
</para>

<para>
When you run Nagios Plugins' configure, it will look for the tap library and will automatically
setup the tests. Run "make test" to run all the tests.

	<para>Variables should be declared at the beginning of code blocks and 
	not inline because of portability with older compilers.</para>

	<para>You should use /* */ for comments and not // as some compilers
	do not handle the latter form.</para>

	<para>You should also avoid using the type "bool" and its values
	"true" and "false". Instead use the "int" type and the plugins' own
	"TRUE"/"FALSE" values to keep the code uniformly.</para>
	</section>

	<section><title>Crediting sources</title>
	<para>If you have copied a routine from another source, make sure the licence
	from your source allows this. Add a comment referencing the ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
	file, where you can put more detail about the source.</para>
	<para>For contributed code, do not add any named credits in the source code 
	- contributors should be added into the THANKS.in file instead.

update the THANKS.in file.</para>
        <para>If you have a change that is useful for noting in the next release, please

<section id="SubmittingChanges"><title>Submission of new plugins and patches</title>

	<section id="Patches"><title>Patches</title>
	<para>If you have a bug patch, please supply a unified or context diff against the
	version you are using. For new features, please supply a diff against
	the Git "master" branch.</para>

	<para>Patches should be submitted via 
	<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=29880&amp;atid=397599">SourceForge's
	tracker system for Nagiosplug patches</ulink> 
	and be announced to the nagiosplug-devel mailing list.</para>

	<para>Submission of a patch implies that the submmitter acknowledges that they
	are the author of the code (or have permission from the author to release the code)
	and agree that the code can be released under the GPL. The copyright for the changes will 
	then revert to the Nagios Plugin Development Team - this is required so that any copyright 
	infringements can be investigated quickly without contacting a huge list of copyright holders.
	Credit will always be given for any patches through a THANKS file in the distribution.</para>
	</section>


	<section id="Contributedplugins"><title>Contributed plugins</title>
	<para>Plugins that have been contributed to the project and 
	distributed with the Nagios Plugin files are held in the contrib/ directory and are not installed
	by default. These plugins are not officially supported by the team. 
	The current policy is that these plugins should be owned and maintained by the original 
	contributor, preferably hosted on <ulink url="http://exchange.nagios.org">Nagios Exchange</ulink>.
	</para>
	<para>If patches or bugs are raised to an contributed plugin, we will start communications with the
	original contributor, but seek to remove the plugin from our distribution.
	</para>
	<para>The aim is to distribute only code that the Nagios Plugin team are responsible for.

	<section id="Newplugins"><title>New plugins</title>
	<para>If you would like others to use your plugins, please add it to
