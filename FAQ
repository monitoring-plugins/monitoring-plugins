Frequently Asked Questions
**************************

Q: Where can I find documentation for <insert name> plugin?

A: All plugins that comply with minimal development guideline for
   this project include internal documentation.  The documentation
   can be read executing plugin with the -h or --help option. If 
   the '-h' option does not work, that is a bug.


Q: What version of <insert name> plugin am I running?

A: All plugins that comply with minimal development guideline for
   this project include detailed version information.  When executed
   with the '-V' option, a version string will be printed:

   check_radius v1.4.16 (monitoring-plugins 1.4.16)

   All bug reports and help requests should reference this
   information.


Q: What information do I need to include when asking for help or
   submitting a bug report?

A: At a minimum, the output from 'uname -a' and the version string
   from '<plugin_name> -V' and, of course, a description of the
   problem and any solution/patch.


Q: I get an error like

   Warning: Return code of 127 for check of service 'PING' on host 'anyhost' was out of bounds.

   when I run Nagios. (Often check_ping runs just fine on the
   command line).

A: Commonly, system administrators will make security as tight as
   possible on the monitoring system. Sometimes this includes OS
   options or hardening scripts that prevent unprivileged users from
   running the ping command. Nagios runs with no more privileges
   than 'nobody' -- check to be sure that the nagios user can
   actually run check ping.  (This can also happen with other binaries
   executed by nagios, but ping seems to be far and away the biggest
   offender.)


Q: I have a plugin to offer. What can I do?

A: You can make it available on MonitoringExchange (http://monitoringexchange.org)
   where other people can find it for use.

   You can also get feedback on improving the plugin via the 
   devel@monitoring-plugins.org mailing list.
